# Brief Overview

This repository contains my notes on getting started with google colab and two projects implemented in colaboratory.

* **edgeDetection.ipynb** - I have implemented a canny edge detector that processes image stored in your google drive and writes back the result (output image) from the edge detector to your drive. This project aims to familiarize with permitting Colab to access your google drive and on installing/ implementing numpy and opencv functions.

* **MNISTwithPytorchAndColab.ipynb** - This project is an implementation of LENET architecture to train/ test MNIST dataset using pytorch library. The code is structured to access GPU mode in Colab during both training and testing.
